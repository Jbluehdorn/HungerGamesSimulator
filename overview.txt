Hunger Games Simulator Overview

20 coaches per round, 7 rounds

Weapons		= [ Sword x5, Bow x5, Axe x5 ]
Coaches		= [ LIST_OF_COACHES ]
	Coach.state		  = [ ‘None’, ‘Hiding’, ‘Running’]
	Coach.weapon		= [ WEAPON]
Actions		= [ ’Attacked’, ‘Picked Up’, ‘Hid’, ‘Ran’ ]
Targets		= [ [LIST_OF_COACHES], [HIDING_OBJECTS], 
			      [AVAILABLE_OBJECTS], [AVAILABLE_WEAPONS] ]
AVAILABLE_OBJECTS = [‘Berries’]. (OTHERS?)

Stages : 
	- Initialize Sim
		- Randomize coaches, re-randomize every iteration
		- Weapon Store is initially full
	- Weapon Grab
		- Each coach gets to the weapon store in order of: 
			- Agility - randFloat(0,1)
		If AVAILABLE_WEAPONS.len > 0:
			If PrimaryWeapon in AVAILABLE_WEAPONS:
				Coach.weapon = PrimaryWeapon
				Coach.state = ’None’
			Else:
				Coach.weapon = AVAILABLE_WEAPONS.pop
		Else:
			RUN || HIDE
				Set coach.state accordingly
			
	- Day by Day
		- Randomize coach list
		- In order of randomized coach list 
			- Select an action
				if coach.weapon = ‘None’:
					if AVAILABLE_WEAPONS isn’t empty:
						action = ‘pickup’
					else:
						action = ‘hide’ || ‘run’
							Set coach.state accordingly
				else:
					chooseAction(ACTIONS)
			- Select a target
				if action == hide:
					target = selectOne(HIDING_OBJECTS)
				if action == attacking:
					selectOne(LIST_OF_COACHES)
					if target is hiding:
						#reroll
						target = selectOne(LIST_OF_COACHES)
				if action == pickup:
					target = selectOne(AVAILABLE_OBJECTS)
				if action == run:
					target = None
			- Calculate an outcome
				if action == hiding:
					ex: “Mike Leach hid behind a tree”
				if action == attack:
					Calculate Damage on Target:
						Damage = RandFloat(0,1)*Strength + 
								  WeaponBonus 
						If Target is running:
							Damage = Damage / 2
					ex: “Mike Leach attacked Lane Kiffin, 
						Inflicted 5 damage.”
					Calculate remaining HP for target, if dead, 
					remove from list:
						ex: “Lane Kiffin has died. 
							He drops his belongings.”
				if action == pick up:
					ex: “Mike Leach picked up a battleaxe”
				if action == run:
					ex: “Mike Leach started running”
