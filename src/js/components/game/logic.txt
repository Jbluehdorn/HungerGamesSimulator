        controller.getTarget(coach, coaches) //ensure target != coach, and if action isn't attack, override in controller
        controller.calculateOutcome(coach, target) //for text feed, damage calculation, etc
        generateOutput() //text feed
        updateBoard() //may be handled by v-model
        checkStuff() //mostly, are we down to just 1 coach thus ending the loop
